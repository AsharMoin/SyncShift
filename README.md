## Inspiration
SyncShift was born out of my desire to create a more streamlined and user-friendly solution for employee scheduling and management. Dissatisfied with the complexities and bugs of the scheduling system at my current job, I saw an opportunity to challenge myself and build a better solution from the ground up.

I believe in the power of innovation to enhance work processes and create positive change. SyncShift is not just a project; it's a commitment to delivering a superior experience for both administrators and employees. My ultimate goal is to pitch SyncShift to businesses with outdated software, offering a modern, efficient, and feature-rich alternative to traditional scheduling systems.

Thank you for joining me on this journey!
